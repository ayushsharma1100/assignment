Thought Process
First i developed basic model for user and post for database.
Then i wrote CRUD operations code for user and Post and tested api using thunder client.
After this i started working on frontend.
started from basic login and signup page then moved to adding post and displaying them to logged in users.
Then added delete and update functionality to posts.

This project can be enhanced visually but i have built a working infratructure for now. I have not paid extra attention to visuals currently.
